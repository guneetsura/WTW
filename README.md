# What's The Weather

A Weather App made for all your travel needs.

#How to run?

- Install xampp (8.1.2) and start Apache and MySQL server.
- Create a database in mysql and name it 'weather-sign-up'.
- Create a table 'registration' and add 8 columns each named `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `gender`, `age`, `medical`, `wheelchair` with value of varchar and ID is - set to auto-increment. Keep 'medical' and 'wheelchair' option as NULL OR simply import 'weather-sign-up.sql' and 'contact.sql' from the SQL folder to avoid creating tables.

Open index.php on localhost. And voila! You have a functioning weather app.

Enjoy!
